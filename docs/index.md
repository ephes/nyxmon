# NyxMon Documentation

Welcome to the NyxMon documentation. NyxMon is a minimalistic monitoring application for services and health checks, designed with a clean architecture approach and SQLite as its storage backend.

## Quick Start

1. Install NyxMon with `pipx install nyxmon` or `uv tool install nyxmon`
2. Run database migrations: `uv run src/django/manage.py migrate`
3. Start the agent and dashboard: `uvx honcho start`
4. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8000

```{note}
For detailed installation instructions and development setup, see {doc}`installation`.
```

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on a message bus pattern with commands and events
- **Multiple Check Types**: HTTP checks and DNS checks today (ping and metric validation are planned)
- **Django Dashboard**: Web interface for monitoring and configuration
- **Telegram Notifications**: Optional notifications for check failures
- **SQLite Backend**: Deliberate choice to avoid database dependencies for monitoring
- **Async Check Runner**: Efficient concurrent check execution
